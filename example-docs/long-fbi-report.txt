| TERRORISM, THAT THESE TERRORIST GROUPS, ALTHOUGH HEADQUARTERED IN
BEIRUT, LEBANON, HAVE ESTABLISHED A BASE OF SUPPORT IN THE UNITED
STATES FOR LAUNCHIN: TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST FOREIGN ESTABLISHMENTS
AND DIPLOMATS. THEREFORE, MAXIMUM EFFORT WSr-sid DIRECTED TOWARD
EFFECTIVELY NEUTRALIZING THEIR ACTIVITIES.
VITH REGARD TO THE JCAG, THEIR SUPPORT IS MOST PROBABLY ’
DRAWN FROM THE ARMENIAN REVOLUTIONARY FEDERATION (ARF), MORE
SPECIFICALLY, THE ARMENIAN YOUTH FEDERATION (AYP). BOTH
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE OPENLY ADVOCATED VIOLENCE AS MEANS TO JUSTIFY
THEIR ENDS, THE RECOGNITION OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE OF 1915 BY THE
TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A HOMELAND IN EASTERN
TWRIEY.
INTELLIGENCE SOURCES INDICATES THAT THE ARF OPENLY SUPPORTS
THE ACTIVITIES OF THE JCAS. IF THIS PREMISE IS ACCEPTED, THEN
IT FOLLOWS THAT THE BOSTON CHAPTER AND PROBABLY OTHER CHAPTERS
"OF THE ARF HAVE BEEW IWOLVED TO SOME DEGREE IN THE TWO INCIDENTS
IN BOSTON RELATED ABOVE. THE AYF, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS COME

ADMINISTRATIVE: | TACB, Boston will discontinue submission of daily teletypes
in KAPIKILL in favor of veekly teletypes and bi-weekly reports.

Inasmuch as the investigation of the case entitled "Unknown
Subject (s), aka - Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCAG);
Orhan R, Gunduz, Honorary Turkish Consul, 678 Massachusetts Avenue,
Cambridge, Massachusetts - Victin (Boubing) March 22, 1962"(3S 165-127)
and the inveatigation of KAPIKILL (35 185-128) are contiguous investigations,
TACB, all reports of KAPTKILL will be filed in BS 15-127 and considered
by Boston to suffice as reports for BS 185-127.

Tn the conduct of the KAPIKILL inveatigation, close coordination
with Yassachusette State Police (MSP) and Somerville Police Department
(SPD) is necessary. An element of this coordination (and cooperation) will
be for the foraal exchange of information. To this end, Boston will furnish
HSP and SPD a copy of this Teport consistent with prescrived dissemination

For the sake of furnishing background information as it
relates to KAPIKILL: 1

Mr. Gundiz' Cambridge, Massachusetts, business establishment,
Consular activities, was bombed at approximately 7:LS P.M., March 22,
1982 (BS 185-127). Six (6) weeks later (May L, 1982), he was assassinated.
Similarly, in Los Angeles on November 20, 1981, the offices of Turkish
Consul General Kemal Arikan were bombed (LA 185-301). Nine (9) weeks
later (January 28, 1982), he was ambushed and assassinated in his vehicle
on a Los Angeles street (LA 185-330; ARKIL). -In each of these four (4)
acts of terrorism, the Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCAG)
were implicated.

The two (2) predominant Armenian Terrorists Organizations,
(ASALA) have taken credit for nine (9) terrorist related incidents
in the United States since October, 1980. JCAG has taken credit for
seven (7) of these incidente. It is apparent from the number of in-
that these terroriet groups, although headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon,

With regard to the JCAG, their support is most probably
Aran from the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), more
specifically, the Armenian Youth Federation (AYF). Both organizations

Intelligence sources indicates that the ARF openly supports
the activities of the JCAG. If thio premise is accepted, then it
follows that the Boston Chapter and probably other Chapters of the
ARF have been involved to some degree in the two incidents in Boston
related above. The AYF, on the other hand, has come to Boston's
attention as being involved in relatively minor acts of malicious
activity. However, the fact that AYF documents were found in the
automobile used by the ATkil suspect may now indicate that JCAG is
recruiting from the AYF.

; Boston, in lead coverage of the bombing matter of
March 22, 1982, photographed Armenian Demonstrations at Topkapi,
April 23, 1982 and the Martyr's Day Demonstration at Government Center,
Boston, April 2h, 1982. (NOTE: Martyr's Day commemorates April 2L,
1915 as the day that the "The Genocide" began when "allegedly" the
Turkish Government arrested 25. Armenian intellectuals in Istanbul
and subsequently executed then. Immediately thereafter, 1.5 million
Armenians were driven into the deserts of Northern Syria by Turkey
where they died from the forced march). Certain photographs depicted
what appeared to be the Armenian leaders of these demonstrations.
(The Topkapi demonstration mmbered 15 and the Martyr's Dey Demonstration
nusbered approximately 250 participants). License musbers of vehicles
used in the demonstrations were recorded, Boston interviewed or attempted
to interview el] identified leaders and participants in the demonstrations
for any information regarding KAPIKILL, JCAG and the identities of others
participating in aforementioned demonsirations. Generally, the consensual
attitude of those Armenians interviewed is that they are verbally re-
morseful Mr. Gunduz was killed in the manner vhich he was, but that he
represented a Turkish Government vhich refuses to adalt killing 1.5 million
Armenians (The Genocide). In addition to the consensual attitude of
those Armenians intervieved Blkgents contacting Armenians should also be
prepared to receive a verbal onslaught regarding a full page advertisement
taken out by, presumably, the Turkish Government in bajor U. S. newspapers
on April 26, 1982, which Armenians generally consider to be "the epitome of
offensive propaganda”. This ad, in effect, states that"The Genocide"
never ocourrod and that for every Armenian killed, a ike musber of Turks
aloo lost their lives. BUAgente covering future leads in this and associated
matters ae cautioned not to become involved in a philosophical or political
discussion or debate vith Turks or Armenians in matters related to"To
Genocide".

Tempe, Arizona, vas observed on campus, literally dancing with joy,
when the death’of the Honorary Turkish Consul was announced. He further
advised that this sale Greek student goes out of his vay to develop

The above information becomes even more revelant in view

Gazette, 20L3 Allston Way, Berkeley, California, which stated, "The

every place that houses Armenians, Greeks, and Cypriots. We single out

SYNOPSIS (continued)

and began to roll down the inclining street, UNSUB
Stepped to driver's side of Gunduz' vehicle and fired
four (4) additional rounds from 9 mm pistol through
driver's side window. Gunduz' vehicle, with Gunduz
still inside of it, rolled down street and into a
chain-link fence of a residential property owner
approximately 50 yards from shooting site at afore-men-
tioned intersection. -Eyewitness'accounts indicate
UNSUB ran from scene, passed Gunduz' vehicle, onto a
side street and re-entered street of shooting at the
downhill side of that street. UNSUB was not observed
after that point. After firing 13 shots at Gunduz and
beginning to make his escape, UNSUB peeled his "Nike
blue" Adidas warm-up jacket off (recovered) along with
his sunglasses (also recovered). As eyewitnesses also
said that UNSUB held a second gun in his left hand
while firing the 9 mm in his right hand, a six-shot
fully loaded Ruger .357 calibre revolver was recovered
in shrubbery along a side street which was reportedly
on path which UNSUB made his escape. Compilation of

. eyewitnesses descriptions of UNSUB is of W/M; olive
complexion; black dry, puffy hair; 5'57-5'9" tall;
135-145 1bs.; 18-25 years of age; wearing a "Nike Blue"
warm-up suit with 3 stripes on jacket sleeves and pants
legs; gold T-shirt under warm-up jacket and sunglasses.
Composite sketches made by 3 witnesses. Extensive
neighborhood investigation conducted with no information
gathered superior to that of eyewitnesses with exceptions
that individual dressed similarly to UNSUB was seen at
shooting site pacing (waiting) at least 1 hour prior to
assassination and that "a bearded white guy" dressed
in Army fatigue jacket was at shooting scene and "must
have seen everything.” Preliminary results of autopsy
indicate Mr. Gunduz died of "multiple gunshot wounds
to head and neck." One full bullet was extracted from
victin's shoulder and one complete jacketed bullet taken
from victin's lower chin. Numerous bullet fragments
found in victim's body. Numerous glass fragments
imbedded in victim's facial area. SINCE THE JUSTICE COMMANDOS
OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE HAVE CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THIS
ASSASSINATION BY MEANS OF A VICIOUS AMBUSH, UTILIZING HIGH-
POWERED WEAPONS, SUBJECTS OF THIS TERRORIST GROUP ARE TO BE
CONSIDERED ARMED AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

information pertaining to the assassination of a Turkish b7C

money the operator was asking for, nor was she able to obtain
any information pertaining to the location of the caller. b6
She did say that it did not sound like much money was b7C
additionally deposited. She offered her guess that this was

! not a call originating from the West Coast, because the
money deposited by the caller was "not a lot of money”.
She had no estimate as to how much money was deposited.

during the call. [__ |believes that this was a live

in his thirties and having an accent. She was not familiar

with this accent. She knew it was not a European or Spanish

accent and that it could have been a Middle-Eastern accent,

but she could not be sure. She added that the caller delivered

The call came in to telephone number (202)637-3700,

He was with Gunduz fn his store until about 6:15 PM on the

has been in the United States for eleven years practicing
his trade. Since he is an Armenian, it has been a
tradition in his family since he was a child, to attend
a memorial on April 24 as a remembrance to the Armenians that
Vere Killed in 1915. On April 24, 1982, there was a planned b6
gathering at Government Center, Boston, Massachusetts. b7C
fe had his shop open most of che day, but late in the afternoon
he decided to walk over to the demonstration, He knew his
mother and brother would be there, so he called his wife
and told her to get the kids and meet him at Government
Center. After that, he closed the shop and walked over to
the Center only to find that the demonstration was almost over.
He estimates that there was only ten minutes left when he got
there and as a matter of fact when his wife arrived, everything
was over.
He advised that he does not belong to any clubs
and does not attend church very often, although his children
go to St. James in Watertown, Massachusetts. He loves
America and all its ways and does not have much contact with
the Armenian emigre community. This is because they tend
to resist becoming "Americanized" and sit around in clubs
playing cards, talking about the "Old Country". He believes
the issue of a liberated Armenian is a dead cause, because -
even if Turkey gave them back some land, the Armenians would
not leave the United States to go back. He alsé emphasized
that a lot of the] business is based on reputation and
trust and he cannot afford To get Lavolved with any group
that could be potentially harmful fo his business. He stated that
he knew Turkish Counsel General Orhan Gunduz was murdered on b7C

the 1915 Armenian genocide) every year.

eet who is a] became somewhat emotional
in conveying the general feeling of enmity for the Turks which
exists in the Armenian community. She remarked that she has
difficulty reconciling her own Christian beliefs with this enmity
that she personally has for the Turks. She said bat she felt duty-
bound to produce four sons to somehow compensate for the loss bé
experienced by her father-in-law who lost 45 members of his family bIC
at the hands of the Turks. These sons learned much of their -
Armenian history at the knes of this grandfather. His undying enmity
for the Turks can be perceived in his reaction to the story of the old
Armenian in Los Angeles about a decade ago, who befriended two
Turkish diplomats, lured them to his home, and murdered them. The
grandfather presented him as a man who, having personally avenged
the genocide, could now die in peace. The grandfather, on the other
hand; vas less than a man since he had not sought out and realized
such an opportunity.

Two of these sons now attend the Universtyy of Massachusetts,
Amherst, Massachusetts, and live at the campus. Both will return home

telephone Was interviewed regarding the
shooting of Turkish Consul-General Orhan R. Gunduz in Somerville,
Massachusetts, on May 4, 1982 and advised as follows:
He heard on the radio and television about the shooting
of Gunduz in Somerville on May 4, 1982 and the fact that a group
called the Justice Commandos for Armenian Genocide (JCAG) had
taken credit for the assassination. Around May 4, 1982; when he
heard the term JCAG he said to himself that he had heard that
term before, but could not remember where or when he heard it.
Two or three days later he remembered that he had heard
it while a student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst,
Massachusetts, around 1969 or 1970. He was on the track team >
with an Armenian by the name of [____ J (phonetic) who b6
always seemed to be talking about the Ammenian Genocide and that  b7C
the Armenians needed an organization and slogan to further their
own ideas. He emembers [ot started "playing with words"
and he is 95 percent sure he Feardl eT coin the phrase,
justice Gomandos;- He is not positive shout Armenian Gencoide,
just that vas always talking about the genocide. He
Femembers this clearly becanse. it was about the time of the
Synbianise Liberation Army (SLA) and the Black Panther Party (BPP)
and[__ wanted a similar identification for the Armenians.
, This all took place when both were students at the
University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts (69/70)
and both were on the track team. A lot of the conversation took
place in the Locker Room and, at the time, he just passed it off
as part of the normal Locker Room talk.
- They went their separate ways after graduating and the
- last time he saw| | was three or four years ago in the be
Brockton, Massachusetts area. However, he noted that it has been  b7C
since college (12 years ago) that he heard | talk about
the Armenian Genocide.

Re: UNSUB, aka Justice Commandos of the

ORHAN R. GUNDUZ, HONORARY TURKISH
CONSULAR GENERAL, BOSTON - VICTIM;
PROTECTION OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS - MURDER
Attached Boston teletype advises that at
approximately 7:05 p.m., 5/4/82, United Press
International, Boston, Massachusetts, received
an anonymous telephone call in which a male
caller stated "This is Justice Commandos~of
thé Armenian Genocide. We have just
assassinated the Turkish Ambassador in Boston."
Immediate efforts to locate Turkish Consul
General Gunduz determined from interviews of
seven eyewitnesses that at approximately
6:45 p.m., while Gunduz was driving his usually
traveled route from his office to his
residence, he slowed down to two or.
three m.p.h. to make a turn and was.confronted
by unknown subject who fired nine shots into
the windshield and four into the driver's side
window of Gunduz's vehicle. Gunduz, the only
known occupant of the vehicle, was fatally
wounded with eleven visible bullet wounds.
) Unknown subject is described as a white
male of 18 to 25 years of age with olive
complexion and black, dry, puffy hair.

Recovered at the scene was a 9mm automatic
pistol, a .357 revolver, a warm-up jacket, and
sunglasses apparently discarded by unknown sub-
ject. Composites of unknown subject being
forwarded to field offices and Legats and traces
on recovered weapons being initiated.

By subsequent teletype, Boston Office advises
that information emanating from the Office of
Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts
indicates that the FBI recently refused to
provide protection for Consul General Gunduz.
Boston files contain a letter from Congressman
Barney Frank to the Director dated 4/1/82, in
which he expressed the hope that the FBI would
be able to provide protection for Mr. Gunduz
and take appropriate action to control the
violence of the groups who were responsible for
the bombing of his office on 3/22/82. The file
also contains a letter from FBIHQ to Congressman
Frank which advised that the FBI was currently
investigating the bombing incident and related
that the protection of foreign officials in
this country was the responsibility of the
State Department.

TAMPA IS WELL AWARE THAT IT COULD VERY WELL FIND ITSELF IN

IMMIGRANTS (WITHIN PAST FIVE YEARS) FROM MIDDLE EAST. TAMPA HAS

As a result of FBIHQ Laboratory examination
lof the Browning 9mm semi-automatic pistol:used

to FBI field divisions in which Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) traces have
indicated individuals purchasing a Browning 9mm
with a serial number closely corresponding to
the murder weapon. This investigation is neces-
sary as complete restoration of the Browning

Kapikill is the code name for Boston's
investigation regarding the assassination of
 |Turkish Honorary Consulate General Orhan Gunduz
{0} jon 574/82. 1&3
By attached teletype dated 5/26/82, Boston
advised that they had located a 1976 Volkswagen,
Rabbit, blue-green in color, with Massachusetts
registration == which was abandoned bic
approximately two miles from the assassination co
site. This car is registered to]
age 50, of Boston, Massachusetts. A search of
the automobile produced one pair of Adidas
warm-up trousers (no jacket) which visibly
matched in color and pattern the Adidas warm-up |
jacket recovered at the scene of the shooting. ,

{ responsibility for the shooting of the Turkish onsul
Boston.
Cur revolutionary struggle began in 1975.
Our sole targets being Turkish diplomats and institu-
tions, acts were carried out in Vienna, Paris, Rome-Vatican,
liadrid, The Hague, Paris, Berne, Los Angeles, few York,
Sidney, Copenhagen, Beverly Hills, Los Afigeles, and Boston. |
And today, we claim the responsibility for the act again
in Boston.
$e This is our style.
| [5 le wil) continue our struggle until all armenian
lands are returmed to their rightful owners- the Arsenians. |
fe hereby condemn the declarations of President
Reagan and Secretary of State Haig, for ignoring the histo-
rical reality of the Armenian Genocide following the shooting
of the Turkish Consul General in Los Angeles. It is regretful
: % hear such remarks from the leaders of a nation who claim

An Appeal To All Americans

To Condemn Terrorism
On Tuesday, December 16, Mr. Sarik Ariyak, the Turkish Consul

General at Sydney, Australia, and Engin Sever, an attaché, were mur-

dered as they were leaving home. This brings to 15 the number of Turkish

diplomats and their family members slaughtered in the recent past by

terrorists claiming to be part of a secret Armenian “liberation” movement,

under one name or another. Their stated purpose throughout has been to

kill Turks today, in retaliation for a misrepresented event that occurred three
generations ago.

Beyond the human suffering caused by the shedding of innocent
blood, the fact remains that international terrorism continues unabated. It
seems to us clear that lawlessness internationally will grow so long as
people of goodwill—people who believe in the basic rights of all humanity—
remain passive while such events take place. We have witnessed in recent
months the extremes to which other similar forces will go, in disregard of all
accepted traditional freedoms and international law, in order to achieve
immediate objectives. We must no longer sit back and wait, nor can our
outrage be selective.

We appeal to all peace-loving Americans to join us in a broad condem-
nation of terrorism in any form. We appeal to the incoming Administration,
to the Congress of the United States, to the United Nations, and to the
media of this country to denounce terrorism at every opportunity, and to
take whatever steps may be necessary to bring these incidents to a halt.
And we call upon all Armenians of goodwill in this country to join us in
condemning those few who are bringing shame upon the name of the
Armenian people.

INTRODUCTION
A campaign by some Armenian extremists in the United States to defame
and vilify Turkish-Americans, Turks, friends of Turkey and even serious, dis-
interested scholars of Turkish affairs is increasing day by day. These extrem-
ists are no longer satisfied with propagandizing and propagating their
distortions of history and activities like running advertisements vilifying
Atatiirk. They are now obstructing even the wholly non-political cultural ac-
tivities of the Turkish-American Community through acts of intimidation and
violence. In recent past, threats and bombing prompted cancellation by
municipal authorities of the Turkish State Folk Dance Ensemble perfor-
mances in California. An Atatiirk Centennial night organized by the Amer-
ican-Turkish Association of Houston was invaded and disrupted by violent
demonstrators. The visit of Ambassador Sikri Elekdag to California was
preceded by the bombing of the Turkish Consulate in Los Angeles and
threats directed against the Ambassador’ life.
These are unfortunate manifestations of misguided attempts by extremists
of Armenian origin to perpetuate their ethnic identity through inflaming
hatred of and maintaining hostility towards Turkey and the Turkish people.
On the other hand, we are happy to observe that a great majority of Amer-
icans of Armenian origin do not harbor ill will towards the Turkish people.
Certainly, those few Armenian-Americans who seem to define their ethnic
identity exclusively in terms of hatred of Turks are entitled to say whatever
they like. They can vilify and denounce, and reiterate their distortions of
history. If some Armenians choose to nurse ancient grievances, that is their
right. However, disruptions, threats, and particularly violence are not rights to
be exercised. They are acts to be condemned.
One wonders what specific results they hope to achieve. Certainly Turk-
ish-Americans and Turks are their direct victims, but American interests as a
whole suffer also. Attempts to discredit and weaken Turkish-American rela-
tions adversely affect the United States as well. The Turkish Republic, with a
population of 45 million, makes very important contributions to the vital
interests of the Western World, and the United States in particular, as an
element of stability in Southern Europe. In November 1981 Secretary of
State Mr. Haig stated his views on Turkey as follows:
“Much public attention has Disedy been Gren to our cooperation
with such nations in the Middle Est as Egypt, Isras! and Saudi
Arabia. But our broad strategic approach also recognizes the im-
pact of areas adjacent to the region. Turkey sits astride the most
vital lines of communications in the world. It is essential to have a
strong Turkey, not only anchoring NATO's southern flank, but sup-
porting our presence in the Eastern Mediterranean. Western assis-
« tance to Turkey is therefore essential”
We eamestly hope that those Armenians who currently act only in hatred
will, one day, instead adopt the attitudes held by hundreds of thousands of

Turks living today, whose parents and grandparents perished at the hands of
Armenian bands during World War |. Those Turks have put aside the bitter-
ness of the past and have selected reconciliation as their main objective.
Turks do not harbor any ill feelings toward the Armenians. Turks believe that
continual feelings of hatred and relentless defamation of all things Turkish by
Armenian propagandists and murdering of Turkish diplomats by Armenian
terrorists serve no useful purpose except to contribute to the already numer-
ous problems in the world.
In Turkey today, an atmosphere of prosperity and friendship prevails between
Turks and their 60,000 fellow citizens of Armenian origin who enjoy full
constitutional rights and protection against discrimination.
We Americans of Turkish origin and Turks established in the United States
believe that common sense and wisdom dictate that such an atmosphere
should equally prevail in the United States. Certainly, a necessary step
toward creation of a climate of reconciliation must be the correction of the
serious misrepresentations of history that are the pretext for anti-Turkish
racism.
It is with this in mind and with a view to putting the record straight that we
have prepared this booklet on Armenian allegations.

In recent years claims have been made by some Armenians in Eu-
rope, America, and elsewhere that the Armenians suffered terrible
misrule in the Ottoman Empire. Such claims are absurd.

The accusation that the Ottomans misruled the non-Muslim popu-
lace of the Empire is a blatant misrepresentation of history. Alone
among the great empires of the time, the Ottomans did not persecute
their subjects, but allowed them complete autonomy with self-governing
religious communities, called millets. The major religious communities
—Jews, Armenian Gregorians, Greek Orthodox, and Muslims —were
organized into millets led by their religious leaders and governed
according to their own laws and traditions. These autonomous com-
munities remained in existence until the end of the Empire. How
ridiculous it is to accuse the Ottomans of persecution when Jews and
Muslims, Greeks and Armenians were left to govern themselves in
their own language, to worship in their own churches and syn-
agogues, to maintain their own cultures, to run their own schools and
courts without the interference of the Ottoman government. Neither
the Ottoman Empire nor any other great Islamic Empire ever per-
secuted the non-Muslim minorities or tried to force them to convert to
Islam. It was, indeed, because of this beneficial situation that thou-
sands of Jews emigrated to refuge in the Ottoman Empire from
Christian persecution following the reconquest of Spain in the late
15th century as well as from periodic persecutions in France, Central
Europe and, particularly, in Russia in later times. Right to the end of
the Empire it always was a place of refuge for the persecuted of the
world.

Self-government, of course, did not always work to the advantage of
the subjects of the Sultan. Without serious interference in the affairs |
of the millets, the religious leaders were left to do as they wished with |
their followers. In general, the Christian millets, both Greek Orthodox |
and Armenian Gregorian, were operated by religious-economic
oligarchies to their own advantage. The subjects suffered not so
much from Ottoman misrule as from the misrule of their own leaders

until the 19th century Ottoman reformers compelled the millets to
democratize their ways through the formation of secular councils and
other devices to check the absolute power of the patriarchs and
priests.

There was, indeed, injustice which resulted from the anarchy that
prevailed in the Ottoman Empire during the centuries of its decay,
particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, but Muslims and non-
Muslims suffered equally. The latter were never singled out for par-
ticular misrule or persecution even in the worst years of the Ottoman
decline.

Turning specifically to the Armenian Gregorian millet, it was governed
by the Patriarch of Istanbul through a hierarchy of clerical leaders
throughout the Empire. It maintained its own churches, schools, or-
phanages, and courts, which operated in the Armenian language
and preserved the Armenian culture. The Armenian millet, as other
millets, was allowed to build vast foundations to provide perpetual
support for its operations. The Armenian millet was, indeed, ruled by
an oligarchy of religious leaders who combined with the rich Arme-
nian merchants, the AMIRA, to misrule their followers so severely
that there were constant clashes within the millet. The sultans inter-
vened only to restore order and prevent the disputes from upsetting
the long-standing stability and peace in which Ottoman society lived.
As a result of the millet system, the Muslim and non-Muslim subjects
of the sultan lived in security and peace for the first five centuries of
the Empire's existence. There was little contact among members of
the different millets, nor were there serious struggles, killings, or
massacres. Each group was thus enabled to preserve its own tradi-
tions, religions and cultures with a minimum of interference from the
central government.

Starting in the 19th century, however, this stability was disrupted and
destroyed by the rise of nationalism among the subjects of the Sul-
tan, first his non-Muslim subjects starting with the Greeks and then,
finally, among his Muslim subjects—Albanians and Arabs. Each na-
tional group exploited its autonomy to develop national societies agi-
tating for independence. Inevitably each group demanded territories
encompassing the widest extent of land ruled by its nationality at all
times in history. Many claimed lands which they had ruled at different
times during the centuries, with the result that most of the claims
were mutually contradictory, and led to disputes over territories
claimed by several of the national groups involved. The only thing on
which all the Christian nationalist groups agreed was that Muslims
had no right to independence. They wanted the Muslims living in
these territories to be driven out so that they could make stronger
claims. So it was that, during the 19th century, as the Greeks, Bul-

gars, Serbs and others won their independence, millions of Muslims
resident in their midst lost their lives, and other millions fled to refuge
in the ever-shrinking Ottoman dominions.
As the nineteenth century ran into the twentieth, most of the subject
peoples of the Empire were able to establish their independence,
due largely to population majorities in the lands that they claimed.
Among the Christians gaining independence, however, only the Ar-
menians failed, since over the centuries, and long before the Turks
entered Anatolia, they had been widely scattered from their original
Caucasus homeland throughout Anatolia and Russia, so that they
were nowhere in a majority. It was relatively easy for the Greeks,
Bulgars, and Serbs, then, to establish their independence. Without
the same sort of population concentrations, however, the Armenians
resorted to large-scale propaganda and terror as they developed
their Hunchak and Dashnak nationalist movements starting in the
late 19th century.
The technique of armed struggle developed by the Armenian na-
tional groups was openly stated in their earliest declarations and
implemented with little change through the last years of the Empire.
Without any sort of majority capable of fighting the Muslims, their
technique was to stimulate strife between Muslims and Armenians,
to incite rebellions, and thus to force the European states to inter-
vene militarily. The objective was to secure the establishment of an
independent Armenian state in Eastern Anatolia. So it was that
Louise Nalbandian, a leading Armenian writer on the Armenian na-
tionalist movement, summarized the Hunchak program:
“Agitation and terror were needed to ‘elevate the spirit of the peo-
ple’... The people were also to be incited against their enemies and
. were to ‘profit’ from retaliatory actions of these same enemies. Terror
was to be used as a method of protecting the people and winning
their confidence in the Hunchak program. The party aimed at ter-
rorizing the Ottoman government, thus contributing toward lowering
the prestige of that regime and working toward its complete disin-
tegration. The government itself was not to be the only focus of
terroristic tactics. The Hunchaks wanted to annihilate the most dan-
gerous of the Armenian and Turkish individuals who were then work-
ing for the government as well as to destroy all spies and informers.
To assist them in carrying out all of these terroristic acts, the party
was to organize an exclusive branch specifically devoted to perform-
ing acts of terrorism....The most opportune time to institute the |
general rebellion for carrying out immediate objectives was when
Turkey was engaged in war..." (Louise Nalbandian, ARMENIAN
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT, University of California Press,
1963, pp. 110-111).

Armenian terror groups operated not only in the eastern provinces
themselves, but also in Istanbul and the other major cities, with arms
and money supplied largely by Russia and other countries as a
means of undermining Ottoman stability and securing portions of
Ottoman territory for themselves. Starting in the reign of Sultan Ab-
dulhamit II (1876-1909), and continuing through World War |, entire
Muslim villages were wiped out, men and women alike were burned
alive in mosques, and the worst sort of atrocities imaginable were
committed in the name of Armenian independence. Bombs were
exploded in government offices, schools, libraries, and post offices,
and the Ottoman Bank in Istanbul was occupied so as to ‘dramatize’
the Armenian message. Muslims were brutalized as much as possi-
ble in order to stimulate reprisals and to bring about cycles of mas-
sacre and counter-massacre, which could only be ended by
European intervention. Realizing the terrorist intentions, Abdulhamit
Iland his successors did all they could to prevent Muslim reprisals for
the Armenian massacres, and they were largely successful.

Itis difficult to believe that any nationalist group would resort to such
tactics to achieve national success. The Armenian Dashnak and
Hunchak nationalists, however, declared their intentions to do so on
many occasions. They did so regularly on the theory that the Arme-
nian national cause outweighed the rights of individual Armenians
who lost their lives as a result of their policies.

This particular policy came to a head during World War I. Armenian
guerilla groups carried out their previously declared intention of at-
tacking the Ottoman Empire while it was engaged in war. At the
outset they developed a plan for an Empire-wide revolt for the pur-
pose of undermining the Ottoman war effort and enabling Russia to
occupy the lands claimed by the Armenians. Starting already in
mid-1914, arms and ammunition were distributed to secret Armenian
bands organized in villages in the Eastern part of the Empire. Soon
after the war started, even before the Russian armies invaded Ana-
tolia, Armenians revolted in the area of Van, massacring most of the
Muslims in the vicinity and establishing their own independent state.
As the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia in 1914 and 1915, the
excesses of the Armenian ‘volunteers’ who accompanied them were
so severe that they had to be retired by the Russians to the rear lines
to stop the barbarities.

In response to the open Armenian revolt as well as the threat of
further revolts, the Ottoman government deported all Armenians
from the areas of Anatolia threatened by war action, sending them to
settlement in areas of Syria and Palestine where they spent the
remainder of the war. Great care was taken by the Ottoman govern-
ment to prevent the Armenians from being harmed during these
deportations. Thus orders were issued that:

“When those of the Armenians resident in the aforementioned towns
and villages who have to be moved are transferred to their places of
settlement and are on the road, their comfort is assured and their
lives and property protected; that after their arrival until they are
definitively settled in their new homes their food could be paid for out
of Refugees Appropriations; that property and land should be dis-
tributed to them in accordance with their previous financial situation
as well as their current needs; that for those among them who need it
I the government should build houses, provide cultivators and needy
artisans with seed and tools and equipment... (Council of Ministers
order of May 1915; Bagbakaniik Arsivi/Prime Minister's Archives, Is-
tanbul, Meclisi Vilkela Mazbatalari vol. 198, decision no. 1331/163).
“As this order is exclusively a measure against the extension of the
Armenian Revolutionary Committees, avoid executing it in such a
way which might cause the mutual massacre of Muslim and Arme-
nian groups...” (Foreign Office Archives, Public Record Office,
London, 371/4241/170751). “Make arrangements for special officials
to accompany groups of Armenians being relocated, and make sure
they are provided with food and other things they need, with all ex-
penditures incurred in this way being paid out of government allot-
ments for the emigrants” (Foreign Office archives 371/9158/E5523).
“The food necessary for emigrants while on their journey until they
reach their destinations must be provided... for poor emigrants by
credit for the installation of the emigrants. The camps provided for
transported persons must be kept under regular supervision; the
necessary steps for their wellbeing should be taken, also to provide
order and security. Make sure that indigent emigrants are given suffi-
cient food and that their health is assured by daily visits from a
doctor....sick people, poor people, women and children must be
sent by rail, and others should be sent on mules, in carts or on foot
according to their power of endurance. Each convoy should be ac-
companied by a detachment of the guards, and the food suply for
each convoy must be guarded until the destination is reached. ...In
cases where emigrants are attacked, either in the camps or during
p the journeys, these attacks must be repelled immediately...” (For-
i eign Office 37/9158/5523). It should be noted that, following the war
1 when the British attempted to try the Ottoman leaders on charges of
1 war crimes, examination of these documents elicited the comments
by leading Foreign Office officials that ‘there is not enough evidence
here to bring home the charge of massacre any closer’ (W.S. Ed-
munds private minutes, 16 January 1920, F.O. 371/4141/170751), and
‘On the contrary, the last paragraph of the order of the Ministry of the
Interior specifically warns against measures which might lead to
massacres (D.G. Osborne minute, 16 January 1920).
During the course of these deportations, some Armenians were
killed by marauding brigands who attacked the deportation caravan

to secure booty as well as revenge for almost a century of conflict
with the Armenians in the East. Far from encouraging the massacres
that did take place as a result, the Ottoman Interior Minister Talat
Pasha sent repeated orders that all measures be taken to uncover
and punish such acts and to protect the deputies in future, as, for
example: “It has been learned that some officials and people have
committed irregular and illegal acts during the transportation of Ar-
menians which was decided on for military reasons and to keep
order. For the purpose of local investigations and to send the guilty to
courts: martial three investigating committees should be organized
and sent.... They should start on their investigations as soon as
possible, and for their daily expenses suitable money should be set
aside from the unappropriated funds of the treasury...” (Talat Pasha,
Minister of Interior, order dated 28 September 1915; Prime Minister's
Archives, Istanbul, Proceedings of the Council of Ministers no. 149).
Itis true, however, that the deportations took place at a time of severe
shortage of vehicles, food, fuel, clothing, and other supplies in the
entire Empire. Muslims as well as Christians suffered terribly at this
time, even in Istanbul and the other major cities of the Empire. Need-
less to say, the people in the countryside away from their homes
(such as the deportees) suffered even more, first on their way to their
places of settlement, and then in those places through the remaining
years of the war. Muslims as well as non-Muslims also suffered from
the ravages of vicious foreign invasions as well as robber bands that
sprang up throughout Anatolia due to the weakening of government
control. As a result of these conditions, as many as 20 percent of the
deportees, some 100,000 Armenians, may have died between 1915
and 1918, but this was no greater a percentage than that of the Turks
and other Muslims who died as a result of the same conditions in the
same places at the same time.

Deprived of the actual massacres needed to force European inter-
vention, the Armenian nationalists, supported by the Gregorian Pa-
triarchate, resorted to large-scale propaganda to spread their
message. In undertaking this effort the Armenians perpetrated false-
hoods. Armenians became translators for many foreign diplomatic
and consular representatives in the Ottoman dominions. They were |
the principal contacts of the British and French missionaries who
were then becoming active in the Ottoman Empire. These Armenians
related their stories to them—and through them to the Christian mis-
sionary societies and churches throughout the world. Armenians
who settled in England, France and America were considered to be
‘experts’ on the Ottomans and were believed in all matters without
question. Gullible newspaper reporters often were entrapped to
spread the Armenians’ tales. Needless to say, European diplomats
and travellers within the Ottoman dominions were naturally lured to

J PE “Yh
JIS 1657-97

the ‘contact people’ of the same religion, who usually knew foreign
languages—and through them these tales were ever more widely
spread.
Because the Turks did not speak out, the Armenians, often joined by
their Greek counterparts, were able to spread the wildest myths
about themselves as well as their message of hate regarding Turks
and Muslims. When documentary evidence was required, they inven-
ted without conscience on the grounds that such documents must
have existed anyway.
What have been the main propaganda messages spread by the
Armenian nationalists from the late 19th century to the present day?
First of all, the Armenians have expanded their territorial claims.
They include not only the original Armenian homelands in the south-
ern Caucasus, but also large Turkish territories in Eastern and Cen-
tral Anatolia. Their aim is to provide the lands and ports needed for a
revived Armenian state.
Secondly, to deepen their claim to ‘regain’ their ‘ancestral homes) the
Armenians have stretched their national existence in Anatolia into
prehistoric times. In order to ‘prove’ that Armenians lived in the area
as early as one or even two thousand years before Christ, they
identify as Armenian a number of prehistoric peoples about whom
historic evidence is scanty or lacking altogether. They like to identify
themselves with the inhabitants of Urartu, though linguistic and other
archaeological evidence seems to indicate the contrary, showing the
Armenians in fact as no more than relatively recent immigrants to
Anatolia.
Thirdly, the Armenian nationalists seek to discount the fact of their
relatively small population in the claimed areas by stating that they
had substantial majorities until they were decimated by large-scale
massacres inflicted at the order of the Ottoman government, first in
the 1890's, and then again during World War I. The Armenian na-
tionalists claim that there were some 2.5 or 3 million Armenians in the
Empire by 1876, that a half million of them died during the reign of
|, Abdulhamid II, and 1.5 million more during World War |, resulting in
the survival of the same one million refugees who emigrated outside
the Empire during and after the war. These figures are based largely
on reports provided to the Paris Peace Conference by the Armenian
Patriarchate following World War | and repeated by Armenian na-
tionalist scholars and propagandists in the years since. However no
Patriarchal census ever was carried out, and no documents ever
have been uncovered to indicate that these claims were anything
more than guesses. On the other hand, there were regular Ottoman
censuses carried out starting in the middle of the 19th century, and

these reports indicate that there were no more than some 1.4 million
Armenians in the Empire by 1914—with no evidence at all to substan-
tiate Armenian claims that the Ottoman figures were invented. In fact
the slow increase of Armenian population during the 19th century and
the early years of the 20th century indicate quite the contrary—that
the losses of population during the 1890's were slight, if any, while
those during World War | could not have exceeded 300,000 at most.
Due to a variety of reasons, far more Turks than Armenians—about 3
million Turks—died in the same war. Very few of these fell dead on the
battlefront. Consequently, one cannot conclude that the Armenians
suffered any more terribly or that the Ottoman government attempted
to exterminate them.

Immediately following World War |, when the Allied armies occupied
Istanbul and other key parts of the Empire following its collapse,
several hundred Ottoman political and military leaders as well as
intellectuals were imprisoned by the British army on the island of
Malta as a result of the accusations of war crimes. The Ottoman
government in Istanbul was anxious to cooperate with the Allies in all
matters, both to preserve the Sultanate and its own existence, and
also to assure the disappearance of the Union and Progress Party
which had run the Empire and dominated the government during the
previous decade. As a result, large-scale searches were undertaken
in the Ottoman archives to find proof of guilt, both of the Union and
Progress regime, and of the individuals held in prisons in Malta and
Istanbul. A few individuals of different religions, Turks, Greeks and
Armenians, were, indeed, found guilty of particular war crimes by the
Ottoman government and were subjected to imprisonment or execu-
tion. However no evidence which could be presented in a court of law
was found to substantiate the accusations made against either the
Ottoman government or the deportees imprisoned on Malta. In des-
peration, the British government searched among reports found in its
own archives, and in the Archives of the Government of the United
States in Washington, D.C., but, again, nothing was found:

“I regret to inform your Lordship that there was nothing therein which
could be used as evidence against the Turks who are at present
being detained at Malta. .... no concrete facts being given which could
constitute satisfactory incriminating evidence... .the reports in ques-
tion do not appear in any case to contain evidence against these
Turks which would be useful even for the purpose of corroborating
information already in the possession of His Majesty's Govern-
ment..." (R.C. Craigie, British Embassy in Washington, to Lord
Curzon, 13 July 1921; Foreign Office 371/6504/8519). In con-
sequence, on 29 July 1921, the Law Officers of the Crown in London
concluded that “The charges made against the persons named in
the Foreign Office list are of a quasi-political character, and are for

this reason to be distinguished from those cases in which Turks have

been held as prisoners of war on the advice of the Law Officers upon

charges of cruelty to British Prisoners of War... Up to the present no

statements have been taken from witnesses who can depose to the |

truth of the charges made against the prisoners. It is indeed uncer-

tain whether any witnesses can be found and it is hardly necessary

to dwell upon the difficulty of finding witnesses in a country so remote 1

and inaccessible as Armenia, especially after so long a lapse of |

time...” (29 July 1921; Foreign Office 371/6504/E8745). As a result, |

the prisoners at Malta were released in 1922 without any charges |
. even having been made or trials held. |

During this time, documents were published in the British press |

which purported to prove Ottoman governmental complicity in the

alleged ‘massacres. Claims were made that these documents had

been uncovered by the invading British armies commanded by Gen-

eral Allenby at Ottoman governmental offices in Syria, and that they

had originated with leading Ottoman figures in Istanbul. However,

subsequent investigation by the British Foreign Office showed that

the documents turned over to the British press came not from the

British army but, rather, had been invented by the Armenian Na-

tionalist Delegation in Paris as a means of ‘proving’ its case to the

Allied delegations. Examination of the photographs of the presumed

documents published by the Armenian delegation confirms the judg-

ment that they were no more than forgeries. Despite this, Armenian

nationalist groups, professors and other propagandists have con-

tinued to cite and publish excerpts from these papers to ‘prove’ that

an Ottoman genocide took place against the Armenian people.

There was no genocide committed against the Armenians in the

Ottoman Empire before or during World War |. No genocide was

planned or ordered by the Ottoman government and no genocide

was carried out. Recent scholarly research has discovered that the

stories of massacres were in fact largely invented by Armenian na-

tionalist leaders in Paris and London during World War | and spread

throughout the world through the British Intelligence (M.1.5).

The objectives of this propaganda effort were: (1) to play upon Amer-

ican sympathy for the Armenians in order to secure American entry |

into World War |; (2) to gain Armenian support for the Allied cause in

America and elsewhere; (3) to secure the establishment, following

the war, of an Armenian national state in eastern Anatolia which

would be friendly to Britain and France, thus to prevent Russia from

displacing the collapsing Ottoman Empire and reaching the Mediter- |

ranean. This cooperation was the result of an agreement made in

July 1915 in Paris between Boghos Nubar Pasha, representing the

Armenian nationalists, Sir Mark Sykes, Middle Eastern Secretary of

the British War Cabinet as well as chief Middle Eastern operative

for British Intelligence, and George Picot, representing the French
government.

In addition to the arrangements already cited, the British and French
agreed to train and use an Armenian Legion composed of volunteers.
This force was organized and developed in Cyprus during the latter
years of the war. While it was ready too late to be used during the war
itself, it accompanied the French forces when they occupied Syria
and Cilicia after the war. Like the Armenian volunteers, who served
with the Russians in eastern Anatolia during the War, the excesses of
its members against Turks and other Muslims were so severe that the
embarrassed French finally withdrew it to Syria. There, it performed .
rear-guard activities during the latter years of the Turkish War of Inde-
pendence. At the same time eastern Turkey was invaded by Arme-
nian guerilla groups sent by the Armenian Republic with the purpose
of massacring or driving out the remaining Turkish population of the
area so that Armenian territorial ambitions could be fully achieved.
The Soviet Revolution of 1917 deprived the Armenians of a significant
source of support, because the Bolsheviks decided on November 20,
1917 to terminate the hostilities. Subsequently, the Brest-Litovsk
Treaty of March 1918 provided for the evacuation of Eastern Anatolia
and the disarming of the Armenian guerillas. The Treaty includes
numerous provisions which are quite interesting in that they clearly
demonstrate Russian-Armenian collaboration.

The Armenians refused to recognize the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and
established their suzerainty over the territories evacuated by the
Russians under the Treaty. Under these circumstances, the Ottoman
Army was forced to initiate action to liberate Eastern Anatolia in 1918.
The Armenians confronted the Ottoman forces with highly organized
armies. Meanwhile, they declared their independence in May 1918.
In 1919, Mustafa Kemal launched in Anatolia his nation’s liberation
struggle which was to culminate in the Republic of Turkey. 1920. saw
the ultimate legal settlement of the disputes between the Turks and
the Armenians. The continuing Armenian assaults in Eastern Turkey
came to an end with the clear-cut defeat of the Armenians by the
Turkish armies. The conflict was resolved when Armenia abandoned
all of its territorial demands on Turkey with the Treaties of Gumrii .
(December 1920), Moscow (March 1921), and Kars (October 1921).
In the years since World War |, the Armenian nationalists have con-
tinued to spread their message of hate, relying on repetition of the
‘big lie’ to secure acceptance of their claims in a Christian world
predisposed to accept the claims of Christians whenever they are in
conflict with Muslims. In the United States, Armenian nationalist
propaganda has been directed by a coalition of the Armenian Gre-
gorian church and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation

(Dashnaks), whose central office is in Boston, Massachusetts. While
the Armenian church works through its churches, priests and re-
ligious schools throughout the country, the ARF operates through a
network of local Armenian community and student groups as well as
Armenian newspapers and magazines published in key cities. Uni-
versity programs in Armenian studies have been developed through
the National Association for the Advancement of Armenian Studies;
also centered in Boston, with major contributions of money and other
resources being made to Harvard and Columbia universities in the
East and to the University of California, Los Angeles, in the western
part of the United States. Armenian student organizations have been

3 formed at major universities under the direct control of the Dashnaks.
In an effort to justify their anti-Turkish acts, they pressure professors
into accepting the Armenian message without question. Professors
refusing to bow to their pressure tactics have been subjected to
various forms of violence, including efforts to discredit their ability 1
and competence, encouraged and at times actually directed by Ar- |
menian faculty members.
The most recent Armenian propaganda activity has involved the re- |
cording of stories related by aged Armenians regarding the so-called

- massacres during World War |. Carefully coached by their Armenian |

nationalist interviewers, these aged Armenians relate tales of horror {
which supposedly took place some 66 years ago in such detail as to |
astonish the imagination, considering that most of them already are
aged eighty or more. Subjected to years of Armenian nationalist
propaganda as well as the coaching of their interviewers, there is little |
doubt that their statements are of no use whatsoever for historical
research, providing at the most tales of the same sort of suffering |
undergone by Turks in the Ottoman Empire at the same time as the {
result of the same conditions of famine, desolation, foreign invasion
and massacre which engulfed all people of the Empire, but no real
evidence at all to support the Armenian nationalist claim of genocide
against the Ottoman government.

ARMENIAN QUESTION BIBLIOGRAPHY
The Armenian millet in the Ottoman Empire, and the millet system in
general, are described in H.A.R. Gibb and Harold Bowen, Islamic
Society and the West, vol. | in 2 parts, Oxford University Press,
London and New York, 1951-1957, particularly part 2, pp 207-263;
S.J. Shaw and E.K. Shaw, History of the Ottoman Empire and Mod-
ern Turkey, 2 vols., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge and New
York, 1976-1977, in particular, |, 151-153, and II, 125-127, 200-205.
Avedis K. Sanjian, The Armenian Communities in Syria Under Otto-
man Dominion, Cambridge, Mass., 1965.
The terrorist policies and activities of the Armenian nationalist so-
cieties in the 19th century are described and documented in detail in
Louise Nalbandian, The Armenian Revolutionary Movement, Univer-
sity of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1967; William L.
Langer, The Diplomacy of Imperialism, 2nd edition, Knopf, New York,
1956, pp. 145-167 and passim, both based on extensive use of origi-
nal Armenian sources.
The most blatant example of extreme Armenian propaganda applied
to scholarship are the works of the Dashnak historian Richard
Hovannisian, Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918, Los An-
geles, 1967, and The Republic of Armenia, Volume I, 1918-1919, Los
Angeles, 1971, which accept as fact the most extreme propaganda
produced by the Armenian terrorist organizations, while rejecting the
overwhelming archival evidence which indicate the contrary. Even
more extreme, and with less superficial scholarship, is C.J. Walker,
Armenia: The Survival of a Nation, London and New York, 1980.
The purported Ottoman documents forged by the Armenian national-
ist leaders following World War | were published as Aram Andonian,
ed., Documents Officiels Concernant les Massacres Armeniens,
Paris, Armenian National.Delegation, 1920; Aram Andonian, ed., The
Memoirs of Naim Bey. Turkish Official Documents Relating to the
. Deportations and Massacres of Armenians, London, 1920; and
Aram Andonian, ed., Meds Vojire. Haikakan Verdjin Kotoradsnere ev
Talat Pasha. Pashtonakan Heragirner, Bnagirneru Storagrutiamb
(The Great Crime. The Recent Armenian Massacres and Talat
Pasha. Official Telegrams, with Signed Originals). The actual Otto-
man documents issued regarding the Armenians during the war, as
well as Armenian documents manifesting the terrorist plans and ac-
tions of the Armenian terrorist societies were published in Ermeni
Komitelerinin Amal ve Harekat-i ihtilaliyesi (The Revolutionary Plans
and Actions of the Armenian Terrorist Societies), Istanbul, 1919; Esat

, Uras, Tarihte Ermeniler ve Ermeni Meselesi (The Armenians and the
Armenian Question in History), 2nd edition, Istanbul, 1976; and
Mehmet Hocaoglu, Arsiv Vesikalariyla Tarinte Ermeni Mezalimi
ve Ermeniler (Armenian Terrorism and the Armenians in History),
Istanbul, 1976.

Actual Ottoman policies toward the Armenians during World War |
are documented in Salahi R. Sonyel, “Yeni Belgelerin Isi1 altinda
Ermeni Tehcirleri” (The Armenian Deportations: A Re-Appraisal in
the Light of New Documents), Belleten, vol. 36 (1972), pp. 31-69, and
“Tehcir ve ‘Kinmlar'’ Konusunda Ermeni Propagandasi, Hiristiyanlik

. Dinyasini Nasil Aldatt’” (How Armenian Propaganda Deceived the

b Christian World), Belleten, vol. 40 (1977), pp. 137-188, both based on

extensive use of the British archives: and Bilal Simsir, Malta Siir- ’
giinleri (The Deportees of Malta), Istanbul, 1976, uses British archi-
val sources to show how the British failed to find any evidence
to substantiate the wartime charges of ‘war crimes’ against leading
Ottomans as well as the Ottoman government.
The Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire is documented in
Kemal H. Karpat, “Ottoman Population Records and the Census of
1881/82-1893; International Journal of Middle East Studies, vol. 9
(1978), pp. 237-274; S.J. Shaw, “The Ottoman Census System and
Population, 1831-1914; International Journal of Middle East Studies;
vol. 9 (1978), pp. 325-338. See also Justin McCarthy, “Greek Statis-
tics on the Ottoman Greek Population; International Journal of Turk-
ish Studies, vol. | (1980), pp. 66-76, which demonstrates how
population figures were concocted by Christian nationalist groups for
political purposes.

STATES FOR LAUNCHING TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST FOREIGN ESTABLISHMENTS
AND DIPLOMATS. THEREFORE, MAXIMUM EFFORT MUST BE DIRECTED TOWARD
EFFECTIVELY NEUTRALIZING THEIR ACTIVITIES. !

WITH REGARD TO THE JCAG, THEIR SUPPORT IS MOST PROBABLY ’
DRAWN FROM THE ARMENIAN REVOLUTIONARY FEDERATION (ARF), MORE
SPECIFICALLY, THE ARMENIAN YOUTH FEDERATION (AYP). BOTH
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE OPENLY ADVOCATED' VIOLENCE AS MEANS TO JUSTIFY
THEIR ENDS, THE RECOGNITION OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE OF 1915 BY THE
TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A HOMELAND IN EASTERN
TURKEY.

INTELLIGENCE SOURCES INDICATES THAT THE ARF.OPENLY SUPPORTS
THE ACTIVITIES OF THE JCAS. IF THIS PREMISE IS ACCEPTED, THEW
IT FOLLOWS THAT THE BOSTON CHAPTER AND PROBABLY OTHER CHAPTERS
OF THE ARF HAVE BEEN IMOLVED TO SOME DEGREE IN THE TWO INCIDENTS
IN BOSTON RELATED ABOVE. THE AYF, ON THE OTHER AND, HAS COME
TO BOSTON'S ATTENTION AS BEING IWOLVED IN RELATIVELY WIMR ACTS
OF MALICIOUS ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, THE FACT THAT AYF DOCUMENTS WERE
FOUND IN THE AUTOMOBILE USED BY THE ARKIL SUSPECT WAY 10W INDICATE
THAT JOAG IS RECRUITING FROM THE AYF,
